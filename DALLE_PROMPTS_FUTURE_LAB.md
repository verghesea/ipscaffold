## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Recommended Testing Order:

1. **Generate 3 images first** (one from each artifact type):
   - ELIA15 → The Invention (shows core tech)
   - Business Narrative → Solution (shows innovation)
   - Golden Circle → WHY (shows purpose)

2. **Evaluate consistency:**
   - Do all 3 feel like they belong together?
   - Is the blue-teal palette consistent?
   - Do glass elements appear in each?
   - Is the futuristic vibe clear?

3. **Refine base template if needed:**
   - Too futuristic? Dial back "advanced" language
   - Not futuristic enough? Add more "glass morphism" emphasis
   - Wrong colors? Adjust palette descriptors

4. **Generate remaining images:**
   - Once you're happy with 3 test images
   - Generate all 11 section images
   - Cost: ~$0.88 for full set (11 × $0.08)

## 🎨 Prompt Refinement Tips

### If Images Look Too Generic:
- Add: "cinematic lighting", "high-end visualization", "premium render"
- Emphasize: "glass morphism", "gradient accents", "technical precision"

### If Too Busy/Complex:
- Add: "ultra minimalist", "clean composition", "negative space"
- Remove: Extra descriptors, focus on core concept

### If Colors Are Off:
- Specify: "predominantly blue-teal (#14b8a6)", "clinical white background"
- Add: "monochromatic blue tones with teal accents"

### If Not Futuristic Enough:
- Add: "2040s aesthetic", "next-generation", "cutting-edge"
- Emphasize: "advanced", "futuristic", "glass and light"

### If Too Dark/Cold:
- Add: "soft lighting", "warm white background", "welcoming atmosphere"
- Adjust: "subtle warm accents", "approachable"
