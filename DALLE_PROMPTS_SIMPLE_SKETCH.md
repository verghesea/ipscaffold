# DALL-E Prompts for Simple 4-Color Pen Sketches

**Version:** Simple Hand-Sketched (4-Color Pens)
**Aesthetic:** Quick, simple pen sketches like working notes - NOT elaborate technical drawings

---

## 🎯 Base Template

```
[SUBJECT DESCRIPTION], simple hand-drawn sketch with colored pens, quick working diagram style, drawn with blue pen, red pen, green pen, and black pen on white paper, loose sketchy linework, not complicated or elaborate, simple shapes and arrows, minimal detail, scientific working notes aesthetic, like quick sketch while thinking, graph paper background faintly visible, 16:9 aspect ratio
```

### Key Principles:
- ✅ **SIMPLE** - not complicated
- ✅ **Quick sketch** - not finished technical drawing
- ✅ **4 colors** - green, red, blue, black pens
- ✅ **Loose lines** - sketchy, not precise
- ✅ **Minimal detail** - only what's needed
- ✅ **Working notes** - thinking on paper

### What to AVOID:
- ❌ Elaborate engineering diagrams
- ❌ Perfect lines and shapes
- ❌ Too much detail
- ❌ Cross-hatching and shading
- ❌ Dimension lines and annotations
- ❌ Overly technical

## 🎨 Style Guidelines

### DO:
- ✅ Draw quickly and loosely
- ✅ Use simple shapes (circles, boxes, lines)
- ✅ Minimal detail
- ✅ 4 colors: green, red, blue, black
- ✅ Sketchy, imperfect lines
- ✅ Functional, not decorative

### DON'T:
- ❌ Make it complicated
- ❌ Add elaborate details
- ❌ Perfect lines or shapes
- ❌ Cross-hatching or shading
- ❌ Technical annotations
- ❌ Engineering precision

---

## 💡 Think of:
- Quick sketch on a whiteboard
- Diagram drawn while explaining to someone
- Working notes, not presentation
- "Let me show you what I mean..." *draws quick diagram*
- Napkin sketch
- Rough draft, not final

**NOT:**
- Finished technical drawing
- Patent diagram
- Engineering schematic
- Detailed illustration

---

## 🖊️ 4-Color Pen Usage

**Black:** Main shapes and lines
**Blue:** Primary elements (coils, devices, emphasis)
**Red:** Important markers (arrows, warnings, problems)
**Green:** Positive elements (energy flow, solutions, success)

**Example:**
- Draw coil shape in black
- Add field lines in blue
- Arrow showing flow in green
- Problem areas in red
