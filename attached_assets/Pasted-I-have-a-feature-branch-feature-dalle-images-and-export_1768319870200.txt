  The branch was built with Drizzle ORM patterns, but our main branch uses                                                                               
  Supabase directly with Zod schemas and TypeScript interfaces.                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                         
  Please read INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md and help me:                                                                                                          
  1. Show the schema differences in shared/schema.ts                                                                                                     
  2. Adapt the Drizzle definitions to our Supabase/Zod pattern                                                                                           
  3. Merge the new services (they're architecture-agnostic)                                                                                              
  4. Integrate the API endpoint changes                                                                                                                  
  5. Keep our existing patterns
