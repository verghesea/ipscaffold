Since you're using UUID, you'll also need to update the TypeScript interface in your code:                                                             
                                                                                                                                                         
  In server/supabaseStorage.ts (or wherever you define it):                                                                                              
  export interface SectionImage {                                                                                                                        
    id: string;  // UUID as string                                                                                                                       
    artifact_id: string;  // UUID as string (not number!)

  The TypeScript interface already has string types, which is correct for UUIDs. Just make sure when you integrate the code, it stays as string and not  
  number.
