## PRODUCTION NOTES FOR 30-SECOND VERSION

### Pacing Strategy:
**CRITICAL:** Every second counts. This version is:
- **Fast-paced throughout** - no slow moments
- **High energy** - music never drops
- **Visual-first** - less reliance on voiceover
- **Text-heavy** - overlays carry key messages

### What We Cut:
- ❌ Detailed testimonials (no time for credibility building)
- ❌ Use case scenarios (save for 90s version)
- ❌ "The Stakes" callback (no time for story arc)
- ❌ Multiple CTA options (one clear action only)

### What We Keep:
- ✅ The core problem (expensive, slow)
- ✅ The transformation moment (the "wow")
- ✅ Three narratives showcase (key differentiator)
- ✅ Price anchor ($25 vs $5,000)
- ✅ Clear CTA (free trial)

### Must-Have Shots (Priority Order):
1. **Dense patent PDF** (establishes problem)
2. **Upload interface** (shows ease)
3. **Three panels splitting** (shows uniqueness)
4. **AI image generation** (visual wow factor)
5. **Clean dashboard** (shows result)
6. **URL/CTA** (drives action)

### Music Recommendation:
- **Single track** - no time for transitions
- **High energy throughout** - electronic/modern
- **Build to peak at :12-:22** (showcase section)
- **Clean resolve at :22** (CTA section)
- **Example:** Upbeat tech commercial music (think Apple/Tesla ads)

### Text Overlay Strategy:
**Every number and key message MUST be on screen:**
- "$50M PATENT" - establishes value
- "DAYS" - establishes pain
- "$5,000" - establishes cost
- "3 MINUTES" - establishes speed
- "3 NARRATIVES" - establishes uniqueness
- "$25 FOR 3 PATENTS" - establishes value
- "30 FREE CREDITS" - establishes offer
- "IPSCAFFOLD.COM" - establishes action

### Voiceover Pacing:
- **Words per minute:** ~180 (faster than normal)
- **Total word count:** ~90 words
- **Tone:** Energetic, confident, urgent
- **Clarity:** Must be crystal clear despite speed

## PLATFORM-SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS

### Instagram Reels / TikTok (9:16 Vertical)
**Visual Changes:**
- **Portrait orientation** - reframe all shots vertically
- **Text overlays larger** - easier to read on mobile

**Reframed Shots:**
- Patent PDF: Show on phone screen

- Split-screen: Stack vertically instead of horizontally

### YouTube Shorts (9:16 Vertical)
**Same as TikTok/Reels, plus:**

- **Pinned comment:** Drive to website
- **Description link:** Full URL in description

### Twitter/X (16:9 or 1:1 Square)
**Visual Changes:**
- **Square format works best** for feed
- **Autoplay without sound** - text overlays critical
- **First frame must hook** - static thumbnail
- **Direct link in tweet** - "Upload free: ipscaffold.com"

### Paid Ads (YouTube, Facebook, Instagram)
**Optimization:**
- **5-second hook critical** - viewers can skip after 5s
- **Brand early** - Show logo in first 3 seconds
- **CTA repeated** - Show URL twice (middle + end)
