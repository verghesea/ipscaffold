✓ Can you see pen strokes and line variation?
✓ Is graph paper visible in background?
✓ Are there ruler-drawn straight lines?
✓ Is cross-hatching used for shading?

## 💡 Pro Tips for This Style

1. **Be specific about tools:** "drawn with blue ballpoint pen" gets better results than just "blue pen"

2. **Mention graph paper:** It adds authenticity and grounds the sketch

3. **Emphasize hand-drawn:** Say "authentic hand-drawn" or "no computer graphics" to avoid overly clean results

4. **Use engineering terminology:** "dimension lines," "cross-hatching," "ruler-drawn" trigger the right style

5. **Reference specific diagram types:** "exploded view," "cross-section," "isometric" help AI understand the technical drawing conventions
