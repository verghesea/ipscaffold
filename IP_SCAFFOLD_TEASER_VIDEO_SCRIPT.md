## FULL SCRIPT WITH TIMECODES

### :00-:08 — THE HOOK (8 seconds)

**VISUAL:**
- Open on extreme close-up: A dense patent document page filling the screen
- Text is incomprehensible—deliberately blurred and spinning slightly
- Quick cuts of different people (VC, founder, attorney) staring at screens, looking frustrated/exhausted
- Clock ticking in corner, speeding up

**AUDIO:**
- Ticking clock sound, building tension
- Fast heartbeat underneath

**VOICEOVER:**
> "This patent is worth $50 million."

**TEXT OVERLAY (large, dramatic):**
**"THIS PATENT IS WORTH $50 MILLION"**

*[Beat of silence]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Can you explain what it does?"

**VISUAL:**
- Freeze on close-up of confused face
- Patent text becomes MORE chaotic—overlapping, multiplying

---

### :08-:18 — THE PROBLEM (10 seconds)

**VISUAL:**
- Split screen: Left side shows mounting stack of patent PDFs
- Right side shows calendar pages flipping (days passing)
- Cut to: Invoice flashing "$5,000... $10,000... $15,000" (consultant fees)
- Quick montage:
  - Someone scrolling through 47-page PDF at 2am
  - Person on phone: "Can you have this by Monday?"
  - Calculator showing costs
  - Coffee cups piling up

**AUDIO:**
- Music intensifies (tension building)
- Paper shuffling sounds
- Phone notification pings (overwhelming)

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Patents hold billions in value—but they're written like encrypted code. It takes days to analyze, thousands to hire experts, and even then..."

- "47 PAGES"
- "DAYS OF WORK"
- "$5,000+"
- "STILL CONFUSED?"

**VISUAL:**
- End with person rubbing temples, overwhelmed

---

- Beautiful animations of text being written
- AI-generated images appearing

---

### :28-:50 — THE WOW FACTOR (22 seconds)

**VISUAL - Rapid showcase of outputs (dynamic, energetic editing):**

**Panel 1 - Scientific Narrative:**
- Clean, readable text with sections
- Annotation: "Complex tech → Clear story"

**TEXT OVERLAYS (appearing rapid-fire):**
- "3 NARRATIVES"
- "AI-GENERATED VISUALS"
- "3 MINUTES"
- "3 PATENTS FOR $25"

**VISUAL:**
- Pull back to show professional dashboard with all outputs
- Person from earlier (who was frustrated) now smiling, nodding, showing screen to colleagues

---

### :50-:65 — THE PROOF/CREDIBILITY (15 seconds)

**VISUAL:**
- Quick testimonial-style shots (stock footage or customer videos):
  - VC partner in modern office: "We went from 3 days to 3 minutes"
  - Startup founder pitching with visuals: "It created our deck"
  - Patent attorney with client materials: "My clients love these reports"

**AUDIO:**
- Music maintains energy but slightly subdued for credibility

**VOICEOVER:**
> "VCs close deals faster. Founders pitch better. Attorneys wow clients. All from one upload."

**TEXT OVERLAY:**
- Customer logos/use cases flash quickly
- "TRUSTED BY VCs • FOUNDERS • ATTORNEYS • INNOVATORS"

**VISUAL:**
- Split screen showing different use cases simultaneously:
  - Due diligence dashboard
  - Pitch deck slide

---

### :65-:75 — THE STAKES (10 seconds)

**VISUAL:**
- Return to opening image: The $50M patent
- But now it's transformed—clean, visual, compelling
- Side-by-side comparison (before/after) fills screen

**AUDIO:**
- Music builds to final crescendo
- Confident, decisive tone

**VOICEOVER:**
> "That $50 million patent? You can understand it in the time it takes to make coffee."

**TEXT OVERLAY (bold):**
**"STOP GUESSING. START KNOWING."**

---

### :75-:90 — THE CTA (15 seconds)

**VISUAL:**
- Clean, minimal screen with IP Scaffold interface
- Cursor hovers over "Upload Patent" button
- URL appears: **www.ipscaffold.com**
- Quick flash of offer: "30 FREE CREDITS"

**AUDIO:**
- Music resolves satisfyingly
- Final "notification" sound (positive, inviting)

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Upload your first patent free. See what you've been missing."

**TEXT OVERLAYS (sequential, bold):**
1. **"YOUR FIRST PATENT: FREE"**
2. **"30 FREE CREDITS"**
3. **"NO EXPERTISE REQUIRED"**
4. **"IPSCAFFOLD.COM"**

**VISUAL:**
- Fade to black with logo and URL centered
- Social proof line: "Join innovators who stopped reading patents"

**FINAL FRAME:**
- Logo
- **"IPSCAFFOLD.COM"**
- **"TURN PATENTS INTO POWER"**

---

## ALTERNATIVE OPENING HOOKS (FOR A/B TESTING)

### Hook Option 2: "The $5,000 Question"
**:00-:08**

**VISUAL:**
- Open on invoice: "$5,000 — Patent Analysis (3-5 business days)"
- Someone signs it reluctantly
- Hand crumples invoice

**VOICEOVER:**
> "You just paid $5,000 for someone to read a document. There's a better way."

**TRANSITION:** Crumpled invoice morphs into IP Scaffold interface

**Why it works:** Immediately establishes cost pain point, creates "villain" (expensive consultants)

---

### Hook Option 3: "The Pitch Meeting"
**:00-:08**

**VISUAL:**
- Boardroom. Founder presenting to investors.
- Investor asks: "Tell me about your patent."
- Founder stammers, struggles with technical jargon
- Awkward silence, investors looking at phones
- Screen goes dark

**VOICEOVER:**
> "This doesn't have to happen."

**Why it works:** Narrative/character-driven, creates immediate empathy, shows stakes (losing funding)

---

### Hook Option 4: "The Alien Language" (Most Bold)
**:00-:08**

**VISUAL:**
- Open on actual alien symbols/hieroglyphics filling screen

**VOICEOVER:**
> "You can't read this."

**VISUAL:**
- Quick cut to patent document with dense legalese

**VOICEOVER:**
> "But you're expected to read this. What's the difference?"

**VISUAL:**
- Zoom in on patent text transforming into alien symbols

**Why it works:** Bold visual metaphor, slightly humorous, makes abstract problem concrete

---

## PRODUCTION NOTES

### Must-Have Shots:
- **Real patent PDF** (before) vs IP Scaffold output (after) - side-by-side comparison

- **Solution scenes:** Blues, whites, clean interface colors, calm
- **Transition moment:** Dark → Light (dramatic shift creates impact)

### Text Overlay Style:
- **Font:** Bold, sans-serif (Helvetica Neue / Inter / SF Pro)
- **Contrast:** High contrast (white on dark, dark on light)
- **Animation:** Kinetic typography for key phrases
- **Numbers:** Should "pop" with different color/size (e.g., "$50 MILLION" in gold)

## WHY THIS SCRIPT WORKS

### Psychological Triggers:

1. **Pattern Interrupt** — Opening with "$50M" value creates immediate curiosity and stakes
2. **Problem Amplification** — We don't just say patents are hard; we SHOW the frustration, time loss, and cost
3. **The Magic Moment** — The 3-minute transformation is the "wow" that makes this shareable
4. **Social Proof Through Use Cases** — Instead of generic testimonials, we show specific personas succeeding
5. **Loss Aversion** — "See what you've been missing" implies they're currently losing value
6. **Scarcity & Value** — "30 free credits" + "$25 for 3 patents" vs "$5,000 consultant" makes decision obvious

### Structural Strategy:

- **First 8 seconds:** Hook must stop scroll (problem + stakes)
- **Seconds 8-18:** Amplify pain (they need to feel it)
- **Second 18:** The "dark moment" before transformation
- **Seconds 18-50:** The payoff—show the magic, build credibility
- **Seconds 50-65:** Proof—real people, real results
- **Seconds 65-75:** Return to opening (closure loop)
- **Seconds 75-90:** Friction-free CTA with clear value prop

### Cinematic Techniques:

- **Visual Contrast:** Chaos → Order, Dense → Clear, Expensive → Affordable
- **Pacing:** Fast (problem) → Pause (transformation) → Fast (showcase) → Confident (CTA)
- **Sound Design:** Tension (ticking) → Relief (whoosh) → Excitement (crescendo) → Resolution
- **Before/After:** The most powerful conversion tool—show the transformation viscerally

### Conversion Optimization:

- **Multiple CTAs:** "Free first patent" reduces friction, "$25 for 3" shows value
- **Time-based:** "3 minutes" repeated throughout creates urgency and believability
- **Specificity:** Exact costs, exact time, exact outputs (builds trust)
- **No jargon in CTA:** "Turn Patents Into Power" is aspirational, not technical
